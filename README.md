Problem Statement:
One of the hospitals has a patient dataset that contains a wide range of heart-related features. This data allows hospital staff to conduct detailed analyses of heart-related conditions and treatments. We must build a logistic regression model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. Calculate the feature importance as well. The dataset contains data for around 303 patients.
 
Data Description:
age: Age of the patient in years.
gender: Gender of the patient.
cp: Chest pain type.
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital).
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results.
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect.
heart_diagnosis: Diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) (0 = No heart disease, >0 = heart disease).

Tasks/Activities List:
Your code should contain the following activities/Analysis:
Read the heart dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Show the Data quality check, treat the missing values, etc if any.
Transform the categorical data.
Apply the Logistic Regression model.
Print the model results.
Get the feature importance.
